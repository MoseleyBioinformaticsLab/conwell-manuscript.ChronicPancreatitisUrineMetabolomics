  {"id":"benjaminiControllingFalseDiscovery1995","abstract":"The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Benjamini","given":"Yoav"},{"family":"Hochberg","given":"Yosef"}],"citation-key":"benjaminiControllingFalseDiscovery1995","container-title":"Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

  {"id":"flightInformationContentInformedKendalltauCorrelation2022a","abstract":"Almost all correlation measures currently available are unable to handle missing values. Typically, missing values are either ignored completely by removing them or are imputed and used in the calculation of the correlation coefficient. In both cases, the correlation value will be impacted based on a perspective that missing data represents no useful information. However, missing values occur in real data sets for a variety of reasons. In omics data sets that are derived from analytical measurements, the primary reason for missing values is that a specific measurable phenomenon falls below the detection limits of the analytical instrumentation. These missing data are not missing at random, but represent some information by their “missingness.” Therefore, we propose an information-content-informed Kendall-tau (ICI-Kt) correlation coefficient that allows missing values to carry explicit information in the determination of concordant and discordant pairs. With both simulated and real data sets from RNA-seq experiments, we demonstrate that the ICI-Kt allows for the inclusion of missing data values as interpretable information. Moreover, our implementation of ICI-Kt uses a mergesort-like algorithm that provides O(nlog(n)) computational performance. Finally, we show that approximate ICI-Kt correlations can be calculated using smaller feature subsets of large data sets with significant time savings, which has practical computational value when feature sizes are very large.\nThe ICI-Kt correlation calculation is available in an R package and Python module on GitHub at https://github.com/moseleyBionformaticsLab/ICIKendallTau and https://github.com/moseleyBionformaticsLab/icikt, respectively.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Flight","given":"Robert M."},{"family":"Bhatt","given":"Praneeth S."},{"family":"Moseley","given":"Hunter NB"}],"citation-key":"flightInformationContentInformedKendalltauCorrelation2022a","DOI":"10.1101/2022.02.24.481854","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,28]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2022, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

  {"id":"yadavPROspectiveEvaluationChronic2018","abstract":"Prospective Evaluation of Chronic Pancreatitis for Epidemiologic and Translational Studies (PROCEED) is the first prospective, observational cohort study of chronic pancreatitis (CP) in the United States. The primary goals of PROCEED are to define disease progression, test the predictive capability of candidate biomarkers, and develop a platform to conduct translational and mechanistic studies in CP. Using objective and consensus-driven criteria, PROCEED will enroll adults at different stages of CP—controls, suspected CP, and definite CP. In addition to collecting detailed information using structured case report forms and protocol-mandated evaluations at baseline and during follow-up, PROCEED will establish a linked biorepository of blood, urine, saliva, stool, pancreatic fluid, and pancreatic tissue. Enrollment for PROCEED began in June 2017. As of July 1, 2018, nine clinical centers of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer are enrolling, and 350 subjects have completed baseline evaluation. In conclusion, PROCEED will provide the most accurate and reliable estimates to date on progression of CP. The established cohort and biorepository will facilitate numerous analyses, leading to new strategies for diagnosis, methods to monitor disease progression, and treatment of CP.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Yadav","given":"Dhiraj"},{"family":"Park","given":"Walter G."},{"family":"Fogel","given":"Evan L."},{"family":"Li","given":"Liang"},{"family":"Chari","given":"Suresh T."},{"family":"Feng","given":"Ziding"},{"family":"Fisher","given":"William E."},{"family":"Forsmark","given":"Christopher E."},{"family":"Jeon","given":"Christie Y."},{"family":"Habtezion","given":"Aida"},{"family":"Hart","given":"Phil A."},{"family":"Hughes","given":"Steven J."},{"family":"Othman","given":"Mohamed O."},{"family":"Rinaudo","given":"Jo Ann S."},{"family":"Pandol","given":"Stephen J."},{"family":"Tirkes","given":"Temel"},{"family":"Serrano","given":"Jose"},{"family":"Srivastava","given":"Sudhir"},{"family":"Van Den Eeden","given":"Stephen K."},{"family":"Whitcomb","given":"David C."},{"family":"Topazian","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Conwell","given":"Darwin L."},{"family":"Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis","given":"Diabetes","non-dropping-particle":"on behalf of the"}],"citation-key":"yadavPROspectiveEvaluationChronic2018","container-title":"Pancreas","DOI":"10.1097/MPA.0000000000001170","ISSN":"0885-3177","issue":"10","issued":{"literal":"November/December 2018"},"language":"en-US","page":"1229","source":"journals.lww.com","title":"PROspective Evaluation of Chronic Pancreatitis for EpidEmiologic and Translational StuDies: Rationale and Study Design for PROCEED From the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer","title-short":"PROspective Evaluation of Chronic Pancreatitis for EpidEmiologic and Translational StuDies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.lww.com/pancreasjournal/Fulltext/2018/11000/PROspective_Evaluation_of_Chronic_Pancreatitis_for.11.aspx","volume":"47"}
